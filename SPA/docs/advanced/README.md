## When to Use Advanced Features

### Customization

- Building domain-specific applications
- Integrating with existing systems
- Creating reusable company templates

### Migrations
- Managing production database changes
- Handling complex schema evolution
- Implementing data transformations
- Supporting multiple environments

### Performance
- Scaling to handle high traffic
- Optimizing slow queries or endpoints
- Reducing bundle sizes
- Improving user experience

### Security
- Handling sensitive data
- Meeting compliance requirements
- Protecting against common attacks
- Implementing audit trails

## Best Practices

### 1. **Start Simple**
Don't over-engineer. Use advanced features only when needed.

```typescript
// Start with basic implementation
const users = await db.select().from(usersTable);

// Optimize only when necessary
const users = await cachedQuery("users:all", () => 
  db.select().from(usersTable)
);
```

### 2. **Measure Impact**
Always measure before and after implementing advanced features.

```typescript
// Measure performance impact
console.time("optimization");
const result = await optimizedFunction();
console.timeEnd("optimization");
```

### 3. **Document Changes**
Document all customizations and advanced implementations.

```typescript
/**
 * Custom caching implementation for user queries
 * 
 * Why: Reduce database load for frequently accessed user data
 * Impact: 90% reduction in database queries
 * Trade-offs: 5-minute cache staleness acceptable
 */
export class UserCache {
  // Implementation
}
```

### 4. **Test Thoroughly**
Advanced features require comprehensive testing.

```typescript
describe("Advanced Feature", () => {
  test("handles edge cases", () => {
    // Test edge cases specific to your implementation
  });
  
  test("performs as expected", () => {
    // Performance regression tests
  });
  
  test("maintains security", () => {
    // Security-focused tests
  });
});
```

## Common Patterns

### Factory Pattern
Create flexible, configurable components:

```typescript
export function createMiddleware(options: MiddlewareOptions) {
  return async (req: Request) => {
    // Middleware implementation using options
  };
}
```

### Strategy Pattern
Implement interchangeable algorithms:

```typescript
interface CacheStrategy {
  get(key: string): Promise<any>;
  set(key: string, value: any): Promise<void>;
}

class MemoryStrategy implements CacheStrategy { /* ... */ }
class RedisStrategy implements CacheStrategy { /* ... */ }
```

### Observer Pattern
Implement event-driven architectures:

```typescript
class EventEmitter {
  on(event: string, handler: Function) { /* ... */ }
  emit(event: string, data: any) { /* ... */ }
}
```

## Performance Considerations

When implementing advanced features, consider:

1. **Memory Usage** - Monitor memory consumption
2. **CPU Usage** - Profile CPU-intensive operations
3. **Network I/O** - Minimize external calls
4. **Database Load** - Optimize queries and connections
5. **Bundle Size** - Keep client bundles small

## Security Considerations

Advanced features often require additional security measures:

1. **Input Validation** - Validate all user input
2. **Access Control** - Implement proper authorization
3. **Data Encryption** - Encrypt sensitive data
4. **Audit Logging** - Log security-relevant events
5. **Error Handling** - Don't leak sensitive information

## Monitoring

Monitor advanced features in production:

```typescript
// Metric collection
metrics.increment("cache.hit");
metrics.timing("query.duration", duration);
metrics.gauge("memory.usage", process.memoryUsage().heapUsed);
```
